# Satellite Tracker

This is a program developed as part of my Honours project for my Bachelor of Computer Science. It is designed to take Two Line Element (TLE) data from a file or online and store it in an embeded SQLite database.
it can calculate the current and future positions of the satellites, display them in 2d and 3d, and also filter the list based on visability from any given location.

### This is a work in progress and not all featues are implemented
